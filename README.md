# Synaptic Test - Employee Hierarchy

## Setup

This demo app uses Rails 7.2.1. For simplicity's sake, the default db option of sqlite was used but typically I'd use Postgres.

To get started, clone the repo and simply run `rails db:setup` followed by `rails server`.

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the employee hierarchy, where each level of indentation represents another level of employees working under a manager.
